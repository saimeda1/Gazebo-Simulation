# Gazebo Simulation with ROS2 and 6DOF Robot Arm

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for simulating a 6DOF robot arm in Gazebo using ROS2, aimed particularly at demonstrating the arm playing the cello. By leveraging ROS2 integration, the simulation offers a realistic and dynamic environment for robotics research and development.

## Features
- **ROS2 Integration**: Seamless operation with ROS2 enhances control and interaction capabilities.
- **6DOF Robot Arm Simulation**: Detailed simulation of a robot arm with six degrees of freedom, optimized for playing the cello.
- **Open Cad Models**: Utilizes open-source CAD models for accurate and realistic simulations.
- **SDF Files**: Includes SDF files for easy integration and manipulation within the Gazebo environment.

## Getting Started
To get started with this simulation, clone the repository and follow the detailed setup instructions provided. Ensure you have ROS2 installed and configured on your system.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the simulation or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the repository.

## License
