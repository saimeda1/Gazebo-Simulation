# Gazebo-Simulation
Creating a robot simulation on gazebo using ROS2 to create simulations of a robot arm with 6DOF playing the cello.
Used open source cad models on Open Cad and created SDF files to import into gazebo. Currently working on integrating ROS2 with
a robot of 6DOF.

The proper file hiearchy is attached in image but github naming conventions don't allow me to publish this.
